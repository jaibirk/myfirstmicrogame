Project Title: "My First Microgame" 

Description: my game is a go karting game where a character drives around a track encountering obstacles and difficult turns but at certain parts the character can get speed boosts to help them get around the track faster.

Setup Instructions: to open my game you are supposed to go onto unity with unity editor 6 (6000.0.40f1) and open the game named my first microgame and then click the start button on the top and wait for it to start and then play the game

Reflection: i learned to use unity and learned how to use different objects. making the track bigger and adding different interactible objects went well for me and creating a bigger track was also not as difficult. i had problems when it did not let me change the words and it just had triangles instead of words. another challenge i had was that there was lots of errors in the scene section.
